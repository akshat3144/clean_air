"""FastF1 session loading and caching.

Everything goes through here so the cache location is set exactly once, and so
Challenge Day can run with no network. Load every session you need in advance,
then the same calls read from disk.

Telemetry is off by default. It is the bulk of the download and we only needed
it for a traffic covariate, which is not available for 2026 anyway (Position is
empty). Turn it on explicitly if that changes.
