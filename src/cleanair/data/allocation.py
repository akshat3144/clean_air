"""Which physical compounds Pirelli nominated for a weekend.

THE ONE FACT THAT CANNOT BE DISCOVERED

Everything else about a race comes from the API: the calendar, the session
times, the lap times, the tyre labels. Not this. The timing feed reports
HARD / MEDIUM / SOFT, which are RELATIVE to whatever three of C1-C5 were
brought to that circuit, and neither the session nor the event metadata carries
the mapping. It is published in a Pirelli press release.

That matters more than it sounds, and it is the reason this project keys
everything on the C number: a "HARD" at Monaco (C3) is softer rubber than a
"SOFT" at Suzuka. Pool by label across events and you average different tyres
together, which is what produced a physically backwards ordering in our own
first pooled fit.

WHY IT IS A FILE AND NOT A CONSTANT

It used to be ``config.COMPOUND_ALLOCATION_2026``, so adding a race meant
editing Python and pushing. For a product that is disqualifying. Here it is a
small JSON store the API can write, which makes adding a race three dropdowns
in the UI.

The seed values came from Pirelli press releases and per-race F1.com tyre
previews. Anything a user later edits is marked with its source, so a number
somebody typed can never be mistaken for one we cited.
