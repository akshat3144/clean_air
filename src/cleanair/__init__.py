"""Clean Air — deconfounded tyre degradation.

Separating true tyre wear from fuel load, traffic and track evolution.

The short version of the method: inside a single stint, tyre age and fuel burn
move together lap for lap, so no estimator can pull them apart from one car.
Pool the field and the confound breaks, because everything that varies with time
in a race is common to every car on that lap and can be subtracted rather than
modelled.

Typical use::

    import pandas as pd
    from cleanair import prepare, fit_degradation

    laps = pd.read_parquet("data/processed/laps.parquet")
    fit = fit_degradation(prepare(laps, "race"))

    for c in fit.ordered:
        print(c, fit.rates[c].mean, fit.rates[c].lo, fit.rates[c].hi)

Two things worth knowing before relying on the output:

* Degradation is keyed on the PHYSICAL compound (C1-C5), never on the
  HARD/MEDIUM/SOFT label. Pirelli nominates three of C1-C5 per weekend, so the
  labels are relative and grouping by them pools different rubber.
* Results carry a ``context`` of practice or race. They genuinely differ, and
  the difference is a finding rather than noise.
