"""Scoring our model against the published benchmark, like for like.

The comparison has to be fair in both directions, and that takes some care.

SAME TEST LAPS
    Their cross-validation is rolling-origin recalibration on Hamilton's 2025
    Austrian GP, transcribed from their ``CV_Functions.R``: per stint, hold out
    the last ``round(stint_length/4)`` laps, predict one lap ahead, and expand
    the training window a lap at a time to the end of the stint. Training always
    starts at lap 1. That gives 16 predictions across his three stints, and we
    predict exactly those laps.

    This docstring used to say 35, because ``_folds`` was handed each stint's
    last global lap number where its length belongs. See ``_folds`` for what
    that cost.

SAME METRIC
    CRPS from ``scoringrules``, verified against R's ``scoringRules`` to 2.5e-11
    by ``test_our_crps_matches_r_scoring_rules``.
    Their per-stint totals are averaged, not summed (their RMSE total IS summed
    -- see validation/scoring).

NO PEEKING
    Their model sees Hamilton's laps 1..k. Ours sees the FIELD's laps 1..k. That
    is the whole point of pooling, and it is legitimate -- a pit wall sees every
    car's lap time. But it means we must NOT use anyone's lap k+1, including the
    field mean, or we would be forecasting with information their model could not
    have had. So the field's mean pace and mean tyre age at lap k+1 are
    extrapolated from laps up to k.

WHAT WE ARE NOT CLAIMING
    Our design needs several cars at the same lap, so it cannot be run on a
    single driver at all. This is not "the same model on the same data"; it is
    "a different model, scored on the same predictions". Said plainly, that is
    the honest framing and it is still the comparison that matters.

    This replaces an estimator that was wrong in two ways at once. It built its
    residuals from the "field" construction while the scored prediction used the
    "hybrid" one, so the spread described a different forecast than the one being
    made; and it read the field's ACTUAL mean pace at each lap, while a real
    forecast has to extrapolate it. Excluding the extrapolation error is what
    made us overconfident: on the 2024 development set the mean squared z-score
    was 4.02 against a target of 1, and the nominal 90% interval covered 67.6%.
    CRPS punishes that hard, so most of the loss was the spread, not the point.

    What replaces it is a nested rolling origin. For every earlier lap in the
    race we re-run the identical forecaster on laps up to the lap before it, and
    take the spread of those one-step-ahead errors. It is the procedure's own
    track record so far, so estimated-parameter error and extrapolation error are
    both inside it by construction rather than by correction.

    Pooled across the driver's stints rather than within the current one, because
    a stint's first fold would otherwise have almost nothing to measure. The
    quantity being estimated is the accuracy of the forecaster, which does not
    reset at a pit stop.

    THE BIAS TERM

    The same errors also expose a systematic offset. On the 2024 development set
    the raw forecaster ran 0.274 s SLOW on average -- it under-credits how much
    the car gains as fuel burns off, because the drift term reads that gain from
    a noisy field mean rather than from the car in front of it.

    Correcting a forecast by its own measured past error is standard, so we
    tried it, on the 2024 development set and never on Austria. It is REJECTED
    and the bias is returned but not applied. It helps the "field" mode a lot
    (0.730 -> 0.606) and hurts the default "hybrid" mode (0.516 -> 0.531),
    because hybrid already re-reads the driver's own pace level over the last
    eight laps, so a race-long average offset fights the thing that makes it
    work. Kept and reported so the negative result is reproducible rather than
    something a reader has to take on trust.
