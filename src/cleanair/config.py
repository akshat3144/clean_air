SEASON = 2026

#: Total rounds on the 2026 calendar.
#: NOTE: 23, not 22. Saudi Arabia was cancelled. Bahrain was NOT -- it was
#: relocated to Sepang, Malaysia (2-4 Oct) and still carries the Bahrain name.
N_ROUNDS_2026 = 23

#: Completed conventional weekends as of 2026-09-03. These are the only 2026
#: events with an FP2 session, and therefore the only ones with race-simulation
#: long runs. Sprint weekends run FP1 then Sprint Qualifying, so they have none.
CONVENTIONAL_2026 = (
    "Australian Grand Prix",   # R1,  08 Mar
    "Japanese Grand Prix",     # R3,  29 Mar

    "Barcelona Grand Prix",    # R7,  14 Jun

    "Belgian Grand Prix",      # R10, 19 Jul
    "Hungarian Grand Prix",    # R11, 26 Jul

#: Completed sprint weekends as of 2026-09-03. No FP2, so no long runs.

#: Dry compounds for 2026. Five, not six -- Pirelli dropped the C6 because the
#: C5-to-C6 gap was too small to be worth validating.
COMPOUNDS = ("HARD", "MEDIUM", "SOFT")          # as labelled in the timing feed
COMPOUND_CODES = {"HARD": 1, "MEDIUM": 2, "SOFT": 3}   # matches the benchmark's coding
WET_COMPOUNDS = ("INTERMEDIATE", "WET")

#: Pirelli's per-event compound nomination, 2026.
#:
#: THIS MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. "HARD", "MEDIUM" and "SOFT" in the timing
#: feed are RELATIVE to each weekend's nomination, not physical compounds.
#: Pirelli picks three of C1-C5 per race, so a "HARD" at Monaco (C3) is softer
#: rubber than a "SOFT" at Suzuka (C3 too, but as the softest of C1/C2/C3).
#:
#: Pooling by label across events therefore averages together different tyres,
#: and it is what every public FastF1 tyre analysis we have seen does. It is
#: also what produced a physically backwards degradation ordering in our own
#: first pooled fit (Hard appearing to wear faster than Soft).
#:
#: Mapping to the C number lets us pool physically identical rubber instead.
#: C3 appears at all seven completed conventional weekends and C4 at six, so
#: there is real cross-event overlap to exploit.
#:
#: Sources: Pirelli press releases and per-race F1.com tyre previews, 2026.

#: Race fuel load, kg. Down from 110 kg under the previous regulations.
#: CAUTION: sources disagree on whether this is a hard regulatory cap at race

#: The magnitude is not in doubt. Do not cite a regulation article number.
FUEL_RACE_KG_2026 = 70.0
FUEL_RACE_KG_LEGACY = 110.0     # what the benchmark paper assumed (correct for 2025)

#: Lap-time sensitivity to car mass, seconds per lap per kg.
#: From the widely used 0.3-0.35 s/lap per 10 kg rule of thumb. Circuit-agnostic,
#: so treat as a prior to check a fitted value against, never as a fixed input.
#: The benchmark's model fits only ~0.016 -- about half -- because its latent
#: state absorbs the rest. That gap is our headline evidence of confounding.
