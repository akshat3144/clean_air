"""A rate we do not know the sign of is not a measurement.

WHAT THIS CAUGHT

Madrid measured its SOFT at 0.058 s/lap with a standard error of 0.198. The
forecast carried it through labelled "measured", the optimiser read the softest
tyre in the race as the most durable thing on the car, and the plan for a
57-lap Grand Prix came back as:

    C3 x5  +  C4 x52

Five laps on the MEDIUM whose only purpose was to satisfy the two-compound
rule, then fifty-two on the SOFT. The per-session numbers behind it disagreed
completely -- FP1 said the SOFT degraded at +0.49 s/lap, FP2 said -0.008 -- so
there was never a measurement there to use.

The rule: a practice cell must be at least one of its own standard errors from
zero before it counts as evidence about this circuit. Cells that fail fall to a
stand-in, which is clamped against the compounds either side and so cannot
invert the compound order.
