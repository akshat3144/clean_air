"""Tests for the hierarchical race model's data assembly and leakage rules.

The sampler itself is not exercised here -- a fit is 25 seconds and needs a
compiled model, so that lives behind the ``stan`` marker. What IS tested is
everything that decides WHAT the sampler sees, because that is where a
benchmark comparison gets quietly unfair: one lap of the future leaking into a
training window would improve every score and break nothing.
