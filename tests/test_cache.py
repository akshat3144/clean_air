"""Tests for the season-completeness guard.

This exists because of a real incident, not a hypothetical one. The F1 API caps
at 500 calls an hour. Our 2022 pull hit the cap twice and landed 9 events, then
17, then all 19 -- and at each stage the parquet on disk looked exactly like a
finished season. The 17-event version was one import away from being pooled into
a five-season significance test with two circuits silently missing.

So the guard has to fail closed on a truncated pull, and it has to keep working
for the seasons cached before manifests existed.
