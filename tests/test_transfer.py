"""Tests for practice-to-race transfer.

The identifiability tests matter most. Refusing to report an estimate the design
cannot support is the difference between a validation tool and a number
generator, and it was found the hard way: a cell with zero tyre-age spread
produced a race degradation rate of -0.41 s/lap.
