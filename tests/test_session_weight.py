"""Tests for practice-session weighting and stand-in rates.

Both exist because of one weekend. Madrid 2026 is a new circuit with no
history, nobody put a HARD on a race simulation in any of the three practice
sessions, and the SOFT managed two runs where three are needed. One usable
compound is not a legal plan, so the strategy screen refused to answer on the
race the project was built to demo.
